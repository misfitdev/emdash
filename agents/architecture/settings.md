# Settings Ownership And Precedence

This page is the authoritative map for settings that affect project and workspace execution.
Do not introduce another merged project-settings bag. Read raw values from the owning domain and
use the named resolver listed below when a field has multiple layers.

"Personal" means **host-local personal config**: data stored by the workspace registry on that
machine. It is not an account-wide user profile, is not shared with the team, and is not synced to
other machines. "Team" means a repository or working-directory `.emdash.json` that can be
committed and shared.

## Field Ownership

With “Sync local settings” enabled, the desktop value is copied to the remote host (last writer wins; this is synchronization, not a precedence layer). | Files, Git, and workspace-registry worker construction in `apps/emdash-desktop/src/main/gateway/desktop-workers.ts` and `apps/workspace-server/src/gateway/workspace-workers.ts` | Files runtime watchers, Git checkout and workspace-registry working-tree watchers (through the `workspaceContentWatchIgnore` profile in `fs-watch`), and file-search exclusion policy |

## Domain Boundaries

- `ProjectSettingsProvider` exposes stored Git identity, stored integration account choices, stored placement, placement context, and
  resolver-backed tmux. Its only current-settings write is `setWorktreeRoot()`, which validates the
  directory on the owning Host. `DesktopProjectSettingsAuthority` owns patches to Git identity,
  integration account choices, and tmux, including when the Host is offline.
- Every desktop settings writer, including lazy migration write-back, lifecycle finalization and
  worktree-root updates, uses `ProjectSettingsStorage.mutate()`. Host/repository lookups finish
  before its synchronous transaction; patches are applied to the current row inside it.
- Desktop DB JSON stores only explicit project overrides. `tmuxDefaultMigrated` is one-time lazy
  migration metadata, not a user setting.
- Project settings pages are self-contained domain snapshots. Forms patch only touched fields;
  `null` removes an explicit value and restores inheritance.
- Integration account choices are their own desktop-owned domain, independent of Git identity.
  Account patches merge only touched provider keys; GitHub uses the same map and patch contract.
  Legacy GitHub account fields are normalized through `readStoredProjectSettings()` and its shared
  migration before reads, edits, and account-usage counts; current writes store only the map.
- All provider account surfaces, including GitHub, observe the same browser inventory query.
  Account availability and loading/error state come from that inventory; live connection checks
  report health separately and never update saved accounts or credentials. GitHub and form-based
  integrations share credential verification and stable-identity checks; token presence alone is
  not a successful health check. Reconnecting validates
  identity against account metadata even when the previous secret is missing or unreadable.
  GitHub refines the shared summary with required identity fields; historical metadata is normalized
  at the registry read seam. Account removal always names one account.
- Cached issue requests carry the account context in their query key. The server compares it with
  the authoritative resolution snapshot, then fetches credentials for that exact account ID.
  Stale contexts trigger inventory/settings refresh; invalidation ordering is not an identity guarantee.
- Single-account credential imports share `LegacyAccountImports` in
  `services/provider-accounts/node/migrations/`. Provider migration adapters own legacy decoding
  and any required identity lookup. A durable DB marker records completion independently of account
  existence and source cleanup. Registry upserts and imports use the same account writer; imports
  commit the account row and completion marker in one database transaction after secret I/O.
  Cleanup failures retry without authorizing another import; migration reads/deletes propagate
  storage errors. Historical GitHub completion timestamps remain
  recognized at this migration seam.
- Issue list/search execution shares one implementation for request limits, empty searches,
  plugin results, and linked-account identity. Provider adapters prepare credentials and repository
  context; GitHub retains repository recognition and host matching.
- Project account rows use the same explicit-disable and inheritance/reset choices for every
  integration, including when a pinned account is missing. GitHub authentication events carry flow
  state only; project UI reads its effective account rather than a global current-user projection.
- Linked issue refresh uses its saved source account despite a changed or dangling project account
  choice. An explicit project disable still suppresses the integration. Legacy source URLs are
  validated by stable resource identity: mutable title slugs are excluded, while provider host
  and workspace/repository scope remain part of the check.
- The workspace registry is the sole resolver for lifecycle, environment, and file-handling config.
  It passes the resolved `command`, `shellSetup`, and project environment to host-owned runtimes,
  which select their host's default shell immediately before spawning. Commands remain opaque;
  repository authors own their portability.
- Task and terminal providers retain stable identity and runtime capabilities, not mutable launch
  settings. `TaskSessionLaunchContextResolver` reads task, project, host, and workspace-registry
  state immediately before a process starts; task-bound providers receive its zero-argument source.
- Git/GitHub and placement previews must use the same portable resolvers as execution.
- Placement obtains the owning host's structured home path and optional `PathProfile` from the files
  runtime. It must not normalize SSH paths with the desktop's `node:path` dialect or desktop home.
  Older workspace servers may omit the profile only for the negotiated remote-POSIX fallback.

## Deferred And Deliberate Legacy Behavior

- The desktop `shareableProjectSettingsJson` column remains temporarily as a migration source and
  completion-marker carrier. Retiring that column is deferred to a future migration-train step;
  current production reads and writes must not treat it as an active settings owner.
- Historical desktop/project `shellSetup` values are deliberately dropped. They are not imported
  into host-local personal config. Current `shellSetup` comes only from `.emdash.json` or the host
  settings JSON chain above.

## Conversation Preferences And Discovered Options

`ProviderSettingsService` in the conversations slice is the sole desktop writer for provider
preferences and discovered options. It stores versioned JSON in two namespaces in the existing
SQLite KV store, exposed through typed Wire procedures and a keyed live model. Renderer state is
an optimistic projection, not a separate persistence owner.

| Namespace | Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `provider-preferences` | host, provider, transport | ACP: `{ version: '1', options: {} }`; PTY: `{ version: '1', autoApprove: false }` |
| `provider-options` | host, provider, transport (`acp`), configuration fingerprint | `{ version: '1', options: ProviderConfigOption[] }` |

Preferences contain only explicit selections, using native provider option IDs and string/boolean
values. Missing overrides use provider defaults. Pickers contain only discovered choices, including
any provider-owned default alias; there is no synthetic default entry or reset action.
Preference patches are discriminated by transport: ACP accepts only native `options`, and PTY
accepts only `autoApprove`. The Wire boundary rejects fields belonging to the other transport.
Per-field patches are serialized in main; database read failures cannot become empty
preferences. The retired global setting, localStorage defaults, and preference mementos are not
migrated. Draft text/attachments continue to use their own memento.

The app settings service stores the last explicitly selected interface as the global SQLite
`preferredConversationType` setting (`'acp' | 'pty'`, initially `'pty'`). Both interactive creation
flows share it across providers, projects, and hosts. Providers without ACP support use TUI without
changing the saved preference. Opening existing conversations never writes this setting. Creation
waits for it to load and for the form's interface selection to save. The old scoped launch records
are not read or migrated.

Creation flows integrate an icon-only Chat UI/TUI toggle into the provider field, with
auto-approve below for TUI only. Create Conversation exposes no model picker. Create Task and active chat
share discovered composer controls. Creation waits for pending preference writes and copies settings
into the new conversation. Later changes do not alter other existing conversations. TUI task creation
retains its plugin model list as a one-off choice; only its approval toggle is remembered.

The active composer uses cached option definitions with the conversation's own saved selections
while session configuration is unavailable. Cached controls are visible but disabled; cached current
values are never treated as resolved defaults. Session options replace the cache, including an empty
catalog. During reconnect, the conversation retains its last reported controls until new session
options arrive. Preference changes in another conversation do not alter these selections.

Main observes successful live ACP configuration snapshots, including sessions without a mounted
renderer. Discovery does not launch a process or run periodic scans. The cache includes native
select/boolean options, groups and categories. All projects share their host/provider/transport cache.
If that host has no catalog, creation borrows the most recently observed host's catalogs for the same
provider and transport. Within that host's cache, creation prefers a catalog observed for the selected
model and otherwise uses the latest complete snapshot; it never merges option lists across snapshots.
Re-observing an unchanged configuration from any project refreshes its recency. Catalog storage is
bounded to 64 variants per host/provider/transport. Catalog changes refresh open forms across hosts.
Borrowing choices never copies another host's preferences or cached current values as selections;
edits belong to the target host. TUI continues to use plugin model lists. Missing cache everywhere
hides unknown controls. Live provider responses replace cached controls, including successfully
discovered empty catalogs. Discovery failures preserve stored data;
confirmed invalid overrides are removed conditionally so a newer user choice survives delayed cleanup.
Provider-reported defaults and automatic changes never become user preferences.

New automations use shared ACP preferences for their host/provider and reuse discovered option
catalogs. Explicit option changes in creation or editing also update shared preferences. Saving an
automation stores its own option snapshot; opening an existing automation uses only its saved options,
including an empty map, and later preference changes do not alter scheduled runs. Switching provider
or project loads preferences for the target scope. Creation waits for preferences and pending writes.
Automation interface choices stay independent, and each new automation starts with TUI auto-approve
false. TUI approval never inherits or writes interactive preferences. ACP options and TUI approval
travel in the deployment and conversation snapshot, including headless execution.

ACP permissions use the provider access mode; Emdash never auto-approves ACP requests.
`conversations.create` sets the initial config; `conversations.patchConfig` is its sole mutation API.
Provider-option changes patch only their own fields through the host's
`conversations.patchConfig` operation. The host merges synchronously against its current record;
the desktop mirror must not replace the host config or suppress writes based on cached equality.
